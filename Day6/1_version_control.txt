# A same project in production can have multiple versions. 
These versions are maintained using a version control system.

#If there was no version control, then code sharing would have difficult. It could be done either sharing from 
google-drive or pen-drive which is not efficient.

#so we need version control systrm for two major reasons:
  1. For code collabration
  2. For version maintenance


# There are several version control system like git, mercurical, etc. Git is among the most famous
ones.



# The code return in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the saftey 
purpose.
# We can again keep our code to google-drive or some other cloud storage. But, they do not understand VCS.
# So, we keep our code in such cloud platforms which understand VCS. For eg: Github, Gitlab,
Bitbucket etc.
# In this session we use git and github.
