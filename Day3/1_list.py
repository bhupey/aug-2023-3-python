# lists are the mutable datatypes in python
# they are the sequential datatypes i.e they are iterables
# Lists are created by enclosing elements in big brackets separated by comma.

#creating an empty list
data= []
print(data)  #[]
data=list() #using list() built-in function
print(data) #[] 

#list may not cointain homogenous data. Elements may vary in datatype
data = [1,2.2, "hello", [1,2]]
