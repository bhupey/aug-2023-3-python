# You may have diffrent projects with diffrent packages in your system.
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 while other project may require pandas version 2.2
# If you want to do both the projects in your global system then problem may arise.
# To do one project you need ti install one package and for other project the others package
# Now to solve this problem we can use virtual environment
